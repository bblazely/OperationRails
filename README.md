# Operation Rails!

Getting my head around Ruby (and Rails).

Mostly just tutorial content from [the getting started guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) and [quick start guide](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/) at the moment, with some [koans](http://rubykoans.com/) thrown in!
